## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("/home/ruilin/Desktop/ECE9063/Final2/EEG")
library(pracma)
data <- read.csv("delta_theta_alpha_beta-RAHC7_prepped.csv")
signal <- data[,1] 
peaks <- findpeaks(signal, minpeakheight = 10, minpeakdistance = 50)

print("Detected Peaks:")
print(peaks)
```


```{r}
plot(signal, type = "l", main = "Signal with Peaks", xlab = "Sample Index", ylab = "Amplitude")
points(peaks[,2], peaks[,1], col = "red", pch = 19) 
```
